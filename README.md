# Hi there, I'm Hayeon Jeong 👋

I am a **Master's student** in [MCML Group](https://mcml.yonsei.ac.kr/) at [**Yonsei University**](https://maps.app.goo.gl/NRtndJLbFDHCh4vm7), fortunate to be advised by [**Prof. Jong-Seok Lee**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YGwwt6cAAAAJ&hl=en).

My research interests lie in trustworthy and robust deep learning, particularly in image-based generative models. I study how generative models can be designed and analyzed to ensure reliability, robustness, and controlled behavior, aiming to bridge the gap between powerful generation capabilities and real-world trustworthiness.
